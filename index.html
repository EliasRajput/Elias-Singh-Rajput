        <p class="lead mb-4">I am an effective team player and able to communicate at all levels. I have a demonstrated ability to work cooperatively with my peers and to meet deadlines under pressure. I am able to work independently and make decisions under limited supervision. I am also a quick learner, able to understand complex technical issues, relate them to business goals and apply them to practical applications.
<br><br>

I am a student initially from a foreign country. I was born and raised in Moldova but came to the U.S. in the eighth grade. I am fluent in four languages: Russian, Moldavian, Romanian, and English. I have studied French for three years in high school and Spanish in middle school. Being polyglot and culturally diverse allows me to offer numerous benefits to the company, ranging from emotional to professional pursuits. First and foremost, as a multilingual employee, I will contribute to the campus's diversity. As I interact with other employees, I will have opportunities to share my languages and culture, thereby raising their cultural competency. As a result, the other employees and I will help the entire company gain a global reputation. In an increasingly globalized world, my ability to speak others' languages can tremendously increase the number of opportunities available to me. Being multilingual is a necessity in many professions dealing with individuals of different cultures. Without it, the quality of service one can offer across multiple ethnicities suffers. For example, if a doctor is unable to speak the language of the patient in the world of medicine, the patient is less likely to open up about his health concerns, and the doctor is unable to provide the best quality of care to lead a patient out of suffering. My ability to speak multiple languages allows me different viewpoints when confronting problems and trying to find solutions. I can help create solutions that can benefit societies across the globe, which will help the Company create global connections and be known for innovations. I can use my abilities as a polyglot to help build emotional and empathetic connections between ethnicities. These connections would help me to lead and focus multiple groups of people towards a single mission of action, thereby helping to make the company known as an institution that makes positive changes in the world.

        During the quarantine, I had the opportunity to self-reflect and see that I was weak in planning my course work. Learning at home without the direct support and guidance of my teachers, counselors, and mentors, I saw that the responsibility would be solely on me to improve on my weaknesses. Thus, I began to work on strategic planning to help make my academic success path efficient and stress-free. In April 2020, I became familiar with the principles of strategic planning. I realized that in order to prepare in advance for the upcoming school year, I had to say no to distractions, make a list of resources, and use a two-by-two matrix to filter and evaluate all materials I might require or not. A two-by-two matrix is a tool that I use to help prioritize supplemental and academic resources. The way this works is, I look at two objective functions of my choice, plot them against one another, and then place the potential resources on that grid. To improve my academics approach, I first created a graph with "study time" on the x-axis and "efficient learning" on the y-axis. After that, I drew out four quadrants within the graph. I placed possible resource initiatives into the quadrants. In the first quadrant, top left, I organized the most useful resources that required minimal study time but offered effective learning, such as Anki spaced repetition flashcards and the Memory Palace technique. In the second quadrant, bottom left, I wrote the resources that required less study time but were not relatively efficient, such as Bozeman science, Khan Academy, and visual and audio learning sources in general. In the third quadrant, top right, I wrote the efficient resources, but that required a lot of study time, such as a scientific multi-phase experiment. In the fourth quadrant, bottom right, I wrote the most inefficient resources. These resources required a lot of studying time and were not practical such as reference textbooks.

            <p>
              â€¢ In tenth grade, I joined a nonprofit called Jagriti (Awakening) because I wanted to help physically, and emotionally abused youth become independent and strong. I care about helping them find a way out of domestic violence, so I have volunteered for two years. As a volunteer of Jagriti, I receive phone calls through their domestic abuse hotline. I must be an excellent listener because all domestic violence victims, especially mentally abused children, require understanding, and help. I tried very hard to let them know that I was ready to give them a hand. I was able to guide them and provide them with information about legal help and counseling. It is a pleasure to mentor and help other youth in their most difficult moments. Sometimes I call the social worker for them if there is an emergency or need of instant help, in case the victim has suicidal thoughts or wants to run away from home. Today, due to COVID, I provide valuable informational sources, contacts with Jagriti's psychologist and counselor, according to the individual's situation.<br> 
              â€¢ I am the officer treasury of the AJKA International karate club at University of California Riverside. Participated in various on-campus Karate Club events. Participated in raising funds for karate tournaments. Training to become a black belt.<br>
